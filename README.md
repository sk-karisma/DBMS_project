# Hospital Management System – DBMS

## Project Overview

The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive database-driven application designed to streamline the operational, administrative, and clinical functions of a hospital. The system facilitates efficient management of patient records, appointments, billing, doctor scheduling, test results, and room assignments.

This solution improves hospital productivity by reducing manual paperwork, minimizing administrative delays, and ensuring secure and quick access to centralized medical data.

## Abstract

This project aims to develop a robust Hospital Management System using database concepts and web technologies. Key features include:

- Patient registration and management
- Doctor consultation tracking and scheduling
- Automated billing and invoice generation
- Room and resource allocation
- Secure storage and retrieval of medical records
- Test result management and integration

By leveraging a relational database approach, the system ensures data integrity, supports multi-user access, and enhances operational efficiency for healthcare institutions of all sizes.
